# Barebones Neural Network

A tiny 2-layer neural network from scratch in NumPy for binary classification.  
Trains on synthetic data and plots the decision boundary.  

## Features
- Fully implemented forward + backward pass
- No frameworks, just NumPy
- Simple ReLU + Sigmoid architecture
- Visual decision boundary plot

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjitchitturi/barebones-nn.git
cd barebones-nn
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
