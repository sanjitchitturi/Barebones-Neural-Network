# Barebones Neural Network

A tiny two layer neural network from scratch in NumPy for binary classification.  
Trains on synthetic data and plots the decision boundary.

## Features
- Fully implemented forward + backward pass.
- No frameworks, just NumPy.
- Simple ReLU + Sigmoid architecture.
- Visual decision boundary plot.

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjitchitturi/Barebones-Neural-Network.git
cd Barebones-Neural-Network
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py  # or open main.ipynb in Jupyter
