## ðŸ§  Barebones Neural Network

**Barebones Neural Network** is a minimal **2-layer neural network** built entirely from scratch using **NumPy**.  
Itâ€™s designed for beginners to learn the fundamentals of **forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent** without deep learning frameworks.  
The project trains on a simple synthetic dataset and visualizes the decision boundary to make neural networks easier to understand and experiment with.
